Mars News and Weather Analysis
Overview
This project involves scraping news articles and weather data related to Mars using Python. The analysis is conducted in two parts: the first part focuses on Mars news, while the second part deals with Mars weather. The main tools used for web scraping include Splinter and BeautifulSoup, and the data is stored in Python data structures for further analysis.

Part 1: Mars News
Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this section, we automate the process of visiting a Mars news website and extract the titles and preview texts of the latest articles.

Steps:
Visit the Website: Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and identify elements to scrape.
Scrape the Website: Create a BeautifulSoup object to extract text elements.
Store the Results: Store the titles and preview texts in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the keys title and preview.

Part 2: Mars Weather
Deliverable 2: Analyze Mars Weather Data
The second part of the project focuses on analyzing the weather data on Mars. This section involves scraping weather information from a designated source and performing data analysis to understand the Martian climate better.

Steps:
Scrape Weather Data: Use similar techniques to extract weather data, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, and other relevant metrics.
Data Analysis: Analyze the collected weather data to identify patterns and trends in Martian weather over time.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, JSON
